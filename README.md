<h2>C++ Programs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ch02Exercise13.cpp</li>
  <p>This program allows a user to enter an items orginal price, markup percentage, and sales tax rate. With these values the program calculates an items sell price, the sales tax amount and the final price.</p>
  <li>Ch03Exercise7.cpp</li>
  <p>This program is an interest calculator. It allows the user to enter in a set of values to calulate the interest and returns interest total on the unpaid balance</p>
  <li>Ch04Exercise16.cpp</li>
  <p>This program is used to compare between a three different royalty options. Based on the users input(novel price and estimated number of copies sold) it checks to see which royalty option would be the best by seeing which one returns the highest value.</p>
  <li>Ch05Exercise33.cpp</li>
  <p>This program I would classify as a productivity calulator. Its able to calculate how many dishes can be prepared in a set amount of time using three variables; amount time to prepare the first dish, time to prepare subsequents dishes and total available time. </p>
  <li>Ch06Exercise14.cpp</li>
  <p>This is a billing calcualtor, it first checks to see if the income entered is great then or equal to a certain value and it performs different actions based off this. Then it performs additional checks to see how much time was spent on the consulation to calcuate the final billing amount.</p>
  <li>Ch07Exercise4.cpp</li>
  <p>This program will take any string input and remove any vowels in it. It does this by first having the user enter in a string, then it changes all of the letters to lowercase, then it checks letter by to see if its a vowel and if it is its removed from the string.</p>
  <li>Ch08Exercise7.cpp</li>
  <p>This ia an election results calcualtor. It allows a user to create as many candidates as they need and then the user can enter each candidates number of votes. The program then calcualtes each candidates vote percentage and returns the percentages and the winner.</p>
  <li>Ch10Exercise21.cpp</li>
  <p>This is a basic banking application. This application can create accounts with account Holder Name, account Type, balance, and interestRate. It also has some functions that allow the user to deposit, withdraw and view account information. </p>
  <li>Ch11Exercise13.cpp</li>
  <p>This application adds functionality to the previous banking app. It adds functionality so that different account types like savings and checkings opperate differently. We handled these differences in functionality using classes. </p>
  <li>Ch12Exercise03.cpp</li>
  <p>This program was also an election results calcualtor, but this one used dynamic arrays which was an improvement over the first itteration of this app.</p>
  <li>Ch13Exercise17.cpp</li>
  <p>This was a random number generator. This had some specific requirments where the range was 10-100 and the number of random numbers had to be 25.</p>
  <li>Ch14Exercise01.cpp</li>
  <p>This is a conversion calulator that takes feet and inches to centimeters. In this assignment we were tasked to also add some exception handling to check for non number and negative numbers.</p>
